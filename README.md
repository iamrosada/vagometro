## Features

### Daily tracking of IT job postings in Brazil

It collects job postings every day from Gupy, LinkedIn and GitHub repositories.


### Data Extraction

For each job posting, it extracts:
- Tech Stack (i.e. JavaScript, Docker, etc)
- Contract Type (i.e. CLT, PJ, etc)
- Experience level (i.e. Senior, Mid, etc)
- Workplace Type (i.e. Remote, Hybrid, On-site)
- Inclusion Type (i.e. PCD, Women, Black people, etc)
- Educational Level (i.e. Bachelor, Masters, Technician, etc)
- Required languages (i.e. English, Spanish, etc)
- Certifications (i.e. SCRUM PSD, AWS CCP, etc)
- Repostings of the same job and the timespan between repostings
- City, state and company who did the job posting

### Data Ranking 

Each data type has its own ranking that shows which items appears more frequently.

i.e. Tech Stack Ranking shows that JavaScript is the Top 1 most requested language.

### Overview Pages

Each data type also has its own overview page. It filters the data and shows how each item is related to other data types. 

i.e. Experience level overview shows that senior jobs are more likely to be remote that hybrid/on-site, the companies that hire the most are the X and Y, Z% of the job required a Bachelor's degree and so on.
